Funkey Controls: 
A - Jump, Start the game, Restart when the game is over.
B - Restart, press 10 times on title screen to reset the highscore.
L - Change skin.
R - Toggle super speed.
MENU - Close the game.

Space - Jump, Start the game, Restart when the game is over.
Esc - Restart, press 10 times on title screen to reset the highscore.
M - Change skin.

Note that if you want to compile the source for PC, you may want to alter the screen settings in src/main.cpp, to remove SDL_FULLSCREEN (line 30).
